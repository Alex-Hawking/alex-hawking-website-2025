## Welcome

Welcome to version **1.0** of my 2025 website, [alexhawking.dev](https://alexhawking.dev). This project represents the culmination of my vision to create a sleek, minimalist online presence that combines elegant design with interactive features.

## Overview

This site is based upon the concept a **minimalist, text-based website** designed to deliver information in a clean and straightforward manner. The site integrates **graphics inspired by cbonsai** and offers **weather-based interactivity** to enhance user engagement and experience. This site is built using Svelte and Tailwind CSS.

## Inspiration

The primary inspiration behind this site was to develop a **minimalist, text-centric platform** that doesn't compromise on visual appeal. By integrating a tree generation algorithm inspired by [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), the website gains a unique artistic touch. Additionally, the inclusion of **weather-based interactivity** adds an element of dynamism, making each visit to the site a fresh and engaging experience.
